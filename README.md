# LsTraffic - Hide Traffic Apps and Bypass VPN/Root Detection

**LsTraffic** is an Xposed module designed to enhance privacy and functionality for Android applications by hiding specific traffic monitoring apps and bypassing common security checks. It allows users to inject the module into other apps using **Lsposed** or **Lspatch**, effectively concealing selected traffic analysis tools from these apps.

## Features
- **Hide Traffic Monitoring Apps**: Conceals specific traffic analysis applications (e.g., HTTP Canary, Reqable) from the app being monitored, preventing detection.
- **Bypass VPN Detection**: Disables VPN detection checks, allowing the monitored app to function as if no VPN is active.
- **Bypass Root Detection**: Prevents apps from detecting if the device is rooted, ensuring full functionality even on rooted devices.
- **Modular Injection**: Use with **Lsposed** for real-time functionality or **Lspatch** to inject into specific apps.
